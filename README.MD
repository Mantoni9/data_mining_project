# Preprocessing and Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains code for preprocessing and analyzing bike ride data. The pipeline includes data preprocessing steps, as well as tasks related to Task 1 and regression analysis.

## Instructions

1. Install the required packages by running the following command:

pip install XXXX


Note: If any packages are missing, please install them using `pip install`.

2. Open the `preprocessing.ipynb` notebook and execute all cells in sequential order. This notebook is responsible for preprocessing the data. Ensure that the required input files are present in the `data` directory.

Note: If you encounter any issues with missing data or errors during preprocessing, please review the data files and ensure they are correctly formatted.

3. After executing the preprocessing notebook, the preprocessed datasets will be available in the `data/preprocessed_data` directory. Verify that the datasets have been generated successfully.

4. Next, you can choose to either open the `Task_1.ipynb` notebook or the `regression_analysis.ipynb` notebook, depending on the analysis you want to perform. Execute all cells in these notebooks from top to bottom.

Note: Make sure the preprocessed datasets are available before running the analysis notebooks. If any errors occur during the analysis, check if the required data files are present in the expected location.

5. Follow the instructions within the analysis notebooks to interpret the results and perform any additional analysis as needed.
